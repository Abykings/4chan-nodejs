# 4chan NodeJS


A 4chan clone that is written in NodeJS. No front-end libraries are used. It's all vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.


Getting Started
-------------
Make sure you have Node.js, NPM, and a MySQL Server installed.
With MySQL, create a database. If you are lazy, copy this command in insert into the MySQL terminal. ``CREATE DATABASE `4chan`;``
* Update the .env according to your setup. [See here for an example](https://github.com/HappyZombies/4chan-nodejs/blob/master/.env). Make sure that the .env file is in your root directory. 
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node app.js` and you will have your own instance of 4chan running on your localhost! 


There are a lot of features that 4chan provides that are not yet added. The overall core functionality of 4chan is what's currently present. These 4chan features will be added eventually. 

# FAQ 

 1. **Why aren't you using any front-end libraries ?** 
    * This 4chan clone is using vanilla front end becuase this project was made for the purpose of *not* using front-end libraries. Instead, to learn and make sure we all know vanilla CSS and JS, we create the tools that we need without the assitance of external libraries. Perhaps I will create another clone of this project using Vue.js, Polymer.js, and Dojo Toolkit, who knows! 

2. **I want to help!** 
    * Sure! This project is made for fun! I have no intent on publishing this (who knows honestly). Go ahead open an issue if there's a bug, fork, and send requests! The more the merrier.
