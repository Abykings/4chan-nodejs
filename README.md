</p>

## üèÅ Getting Started for Development

Make sure you have latest version of Node.js, NPM, and a MySQL Server installed.

With MySQL, create a database. Copy this command in insert into the MySQL terminal. `` CREATE DATABASE `4chan`; ``

Feel free to mess around with the config/env variables.

- Update the .env according to your setup. [See here for the example env file](https://github.com/HappyZombies/4chan-nodejs/blob/master/.env.example). Make sure that the .env file is in your root directory.

- Run `npm install`

- Run `npm start` and you will have your own instance of 4chan running on your localhost!

There are a lot of features that 4chan provides that are not yet added. The overall core functionality of 4chan is what's currently present. These 4chan features will be added eventually. See the issues for progress tracking.
